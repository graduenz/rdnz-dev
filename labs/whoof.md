description: Simple pet vaccination application with a variety of learning purposes

# Whoof

Whoof is a simple software project of an application to control pet vaccination, created with the main purpose of learning how REST APIs can be implemented in different programming languages and frameworks to enrich my technical repertory, but also:

* Practice with important tools commonly used in software engineering.
* Make it publicly available, running on AWS.
* Learn about implementing a modern front end application.
  * Maybe a mobile application too, in a nearby future.
* Demonstrate and share knowledge with the community.

The ASP.NET Core version is the edition that is publicly available, and it's likely to be the most complete one, being used as the source application to practice with some tools like Auth0, GitHub Actions, Grafana, and more; please take a look at [the repo docs](https://github.com/graduenz/whoof-aspnetcore/).
