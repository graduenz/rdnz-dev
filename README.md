# About

## Introduction

Hello!

You can call me Gui like everyone else; my name is Guilherme Augusto Raduenz.

* I have been coding for 10+ years - since 2011.
* Besides work, I also like coding some stuff to try different tech, programming languages, etc.
* Most of the people call me Gui - pronounced as "give" without the "ve".
* Born and living in Brazil [![Brazil](https://github.com/graduenz/graduenz/raw/main/br.png)](https://github.com/graduenz/graduenz/blob/main/br.png).

## Work

I work mainly with the .NET stack and some popular tools like SQL databases, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, Docker, GitHub Actions, and more. My current focus is on back end engineering, and I'm also into some DevOps / automation / infrastructure as an enthusiast.

You will see more information on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/graduenz/) and on [work-experience.md](work-experience.md "mention").
