# About

## Introduction

Hello!

You can call me Gui, my brain automatically responds to that nickname.

My name is Guilherme Raduenz, I like to solve real-world problems using technology, and I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience in building software solutions for various domains and industries.

I currently work at Truelogic Software, where I help their clients in the US to develop their solutions in health and PBM industry. ðŸš€

## What I do

My core competencies include back end engineering, web apps, microservices, testing, design patterns and the .NET platform (C#, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and more). I also have experience in working with Node.js, TypeScript, Vue.js, CAP, RabbitMQ, Kubernetes, Elasticsearch, and other technologies.

I enjoy learning new skills and tools, sharing my knowledge with others, and solving real problems with software engineering. My goal is to make more impact to the community, the company and the global market with my career, build cool projects and products, and always get excited by doing cool things with my family and friends.

## What I like

Career-wise, my interests are to make the greatest positive impact as possible and work on awesome projects, to share knowledge and experiences with other tech professionals, and to continue consistently studying and improving myself every day.

Personally, I like to spend time with some friends and family, to pet the two dogs I have (a lovely Golden Retriever girl and an absolutely crazy Husky boy), and to get my mind and body healthy through working out, yoga, reading books and articles, celebrating, resting enough, and traveling.

I'm pretty sure there's a lot more, but that is what matters the most.
