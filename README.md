# About

## Introduction

Hello!

You can call me Gui.

My name is Guilherme Raduenz, I like to solve real world problems using software engineering, and I've been doing this professionally for 10 years now.

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Truelogic and I help their clients in United States to build and improve their products. ðŸš€

## What I do

My top hard skills are engineering in the .NET stack: coding in C#, using ASP.NET, Entity Framework, xUnit, etc, alongside tools like Git, Docker, SQL and NoSQL databases, CI/CD tools and knowledge in design patterns and many architectural matters.

I also have proficiency with JavaScript and TypeScript from recent and regular personal projects, as well as some jobs I had in the past, specially creating Vue.js front end apps.

## What I like

Career-wise, my interests are to make a greater impact as a tech lead and work on awesome projects, to share knowledge and experiences with other tech professionals, and to continue consistently studying and improving myself every day.

Personally, I like to spend time with some friends and family, to pet the two dogs I have (a lovely Golden Retriever girl and an absolutely crazy Husky boy), and to get my mind and body healthy through some exercise, yoga, reading books, celebrating, resting enough, and traveling.
