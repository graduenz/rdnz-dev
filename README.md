# About

## Introduction

Hello!

You can call me Gui, and my name is Guilherme Augusto Raduenz.

I like to solve real-world problems using technology, and I'm a software engineer with over 10 years of experience in building software solutions for various domains and industries.

## What I do

My core competencies include back-end engineering, web apps, microservices, testing, design patterns, and the .NET platform (C#, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and more). I also have experience working with Node.js, TypeScript, Vue.js, CAP, RabbitMQ, Kubernetes, Elasticsearch, and other technologies.

I enjoy learning new skills and tools, sharing my knowledge with others, and solving real problems with software engineering. I also like doing a great impact to the community and the global market, and build some cool projects and products.

## What I like

Career-wise, my interests are to make the greatest positive impact as possible and work on awesome projects, to share knowledge and experiences with other tech professionals, and to continue consistently studying and improving myself every day.

Personally, I like to spend time with some friends and family, to pet the two dogs I have (a lovely Golden Retriever girl and an absolutely crazy Husky boy), and to get my mind and body healthy through working out, yoga, reading books and articles, celebrating, resting enough, and traveling.

I'm pretty sure there's a lot more, but that is what matters most.
